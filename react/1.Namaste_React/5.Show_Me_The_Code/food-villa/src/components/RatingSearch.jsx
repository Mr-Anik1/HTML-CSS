/*
Since setRating is an asynchronous function, the state update won't happen immediately. So when you call handleRatingSearch(rating) immediately after setRating, rating may not have been updated yet.

In this version, we're passing selectedRating (the value from event.target.value) directly to handleRatingSearch, ensuring that we're using the most up-to-date value of the rating. This way, you won't encounter any synchronization issues between state updates and function calls.
