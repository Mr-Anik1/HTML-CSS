#### Remove console with this package:

- babel-plugin-transform-remove-console

JSX is HTML like syntex, but it is not HTML inside JavaScript.

```
React.createElement => Object => HTML(DOM)
```

React.createElement gives an object, and the object gets converted to HTML, which is rendered to the DOM.

```
JSX => React.createElement => Object => HTML(DOM)
```

JSX uses React.createElement and React.createElement gives an object, and the object gets converted to HTML, which is rendered to the DOM.

JSX is not React; behind the sense, Babel is converting JSX to React.createElement.
